# Scrapy-Splash_Scrape_LiveCoin

In this project i used python to scrape cryptocurrenties latest prices using Scrapy-Splash and store result in .json format.
As Scrapy cannot scrape dynamic webpage content itself, so I used splash to get the dynamically loaded content (prices) and parsed data in scrapy.

- Scrapy
- Splash
- scrapy-splash

Please read the documentation link given below in order to setup Splash on docker:
https://pypi.org/project/scrapy-splash/
